# MATLAB-wordle

This is freshman-year code, so it's a little rough around the edges. However, this is one of the most enjoyable projects I've worked on in college. We were merely meant to design a simple game like a text-based hang-man, twenty-one, connect four, or something similar, but I looked at the resources offered and set a goal for myself to create a game that I would be proud of.

MATLAB-wordle is a clone of the infamous game "Wordle". But instead of limitting to one turn each day like Wordle, this game allows you to play unlimitted amout of times!
